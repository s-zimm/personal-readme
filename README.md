## How to work with Seth Zimmerman

### Words that describe me:
**Goofy** | **Flexible** | **Team Player** | **Approachable** | **Trustworthy** | **Level Headed**

### When to reach me:
I am usually available from around 9-6. Since we have stand-ups starting at 10, I like to have that hour before stand up to look back over the work I did yesterday, or if it's time for new work, check out our teamroom to see what stories and defects need to get done (also taking this time to read about them and gain context). I don't necessarily have a preference for meeting times, but I do like when they are immediately after stand-ups or at 10:30am EST since we usually have some established context from discussions within stand-ups.

### How to reach me:
Slack is best. I try to check my email for those "once-in-a-while" important emails to come through, but if you're needing immediate feedback, Slack is the way!

If I donâ€™t respond, try sending me a funny gif to get my attention.

### My feedback style:
I like to keep feedback positive, but constructive (this goes for giving and receiving). I feel it is important to point out areas of good work as well as areas that can be improved. Within PR/review setting, this could be pointing out something I learned from the PR ("Oh, I never knew about that syntax, awesome!") or just something that stands out to me ("These lines are very clever and clear, nice work!"). Within areas that need improvement, feedback should be constructive and concise. If it's not concise, it may be worth having a 1:1 conversation over (or small group convo).

### What gets my goat?
Myself, sometimes, for keeping thoughts to myself that should probably be shared. Spending too much time talking about minutiae. Hubris.
